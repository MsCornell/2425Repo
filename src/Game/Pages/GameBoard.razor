                    1. Board Setup: At the beginning of the game, there are multiple Tic Tac Toe boards,
                    all in an empty state. Players take turns making moves on the boards until one of the boards is completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Move Rules: Players take turns choosing an unfinished board and making a move on it.
                    Each board follows the traditional Tic Tac Toe rules: a player wins by getting three in a row
                    (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Board Completion and Selection: When a player wins on a board or it ends in a draw, that board is considered completed.
                    The next player then selects an unfinished board to continue the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Winning the Game: The game continues until all boards are completed.
                    The player who wins the majority of the boards is declared the overall winner.
